"""One host, however many channels of it are configured.

Everything in here is keyed by address rather than by config entry: whether the
host is reachable, how many times it has refused credentials, the shared HTTP
connector, the uptime sample that tells a channel apart from a reboot, whether the
device numbers its channels from zero, and the one event stream every channel of a
host reads from.

separate things: this, the coordinator, and the config entry lifecycle. Nothing
here knows what a coordinator is, which is what lets the split run in this
